I am a CS grad student at the _University of Maryland, Baltimore County_. I love distributed systems, scalability & infrastructure challenges, and startups. In summer 2018, I interned at <a href="A9.com">A9.com</a> - an **Amazon** company in Palo Alto, CA that handles Search and Advertising Technologies. Before joining grad school, I worked as a Software Engineer for 3 years at <a href="http://www.sokrati.com">Sokrati</a>. I write on Quora - both in <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B3%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0-Shreyas-Panhalkar">English</a> and <a href='https://mr.quora.com/profile/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B3%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0-Shreyas-Panhalkar'>Marathi</a>. When I am not coding or writing, I spend my time watching movies and TV shows.
